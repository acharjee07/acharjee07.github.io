I'm Sanjay Acharjee, a passionate and forward-thinking engineer on a mission to reshape our world for the better. Having recently graduated from BUET, I'm fueled by a relentless drive to tackle complex challenges such as traffic congestion, environmental pollution, and overpopulation. It was during my early college years that I stumbled upon the captivating world of deep learning, and since then, I have dedicated myself to unraveling its potential.

With a primary focus on computer vision research, I have delved deep into the realms of data science and machine learning. This journey has been both exhilarating and rewarding, culminating in notable achievements such as clinching the prestigious title of the IEEE Video and Image Processing Cup. Collaborating with a talented team, we demonstrated our prowess in leveraging cutting-edge technologies to create impactful solutions.

Proficient in programming languages like Python, C++, and with hands-on experience in popular machine learning frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow, I bring a diverse skill set to the table. My expertise extends to areas such as deep learning, computer vision, and data analysis, enabling me to develop innovative approaches to address critical issues.

Driven by a strong commitment to sustainability, I strive to create lasting change through my work. By pushing the boundaries of innovation and harnessing the power of technology, I aim to pave the way for a brighter and more sustainable future. I firmly believe that our collective efforts can lead to meaningful transformations that will empower future generations.
